When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

  * When I'm collaborating with other people on a project  
  * When I want to share my code with someone  
  * When I want to be able to edit code from multiple different computers and keep the 
  code up-to-date on all the computers.  
  * Can be a good way to keep a backup of my work.
